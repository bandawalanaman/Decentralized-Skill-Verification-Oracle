# Decentralized Skill Verification Oracle

## Project Overview

The **Decentralized Skill Verification Oracle** is a blockchain-based protocol designed to provide trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof verification of users' skills and qualifications. It leverages decentralized oracle networks to validate skill claims and records verified data on-chain, enabling individuals to prove their abilities without relying on centralized authorities.

## Features

- **Decentralized Verification:** Multiple independent oracles verify skill claims to prevent fraud.
- **Immutable Records:** Verified skills are permanently stored on the blockchain.
- **User-Controlled Privacy:** Users control which skills to share and with whom.
- **Incentivized Oracles:** Oracles are rewarded for honest verification.
- **Easy Integration:** Compatible with decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain systems.

## How It Works

1. **Claim Submission:** Users submit skill claims along with supporting evidence.
2. **Oracle Assignment:** The system assigns several oracles to validate the claim.
3. **Verification:** Oracles independently assess the evidence and submit votes.
4. **Consensus:** Once a threshold of agreement is reached, the skill is marked verified.
5. **On-Chain Record:** Verified skill data is recorded immutably on the blockchain.
6. **Sharing:** Users can share their verified skills securely with employers or platforms.

## Things you need to do:

- **Project.sol file** – Rename this file and add the Solidity smart contract code inside it.
- **deploy.js file** – Add the JavaScript deployment script code inside it.
- **.env.example** – Add the Private Key of your MetaMask wallet's account (never commit actual private keys).
- **README.md file** – Add this README content inside this file.
- **package.json file** – Replace the `"name"` property value from `"Project-Title"` to your actual project title.  
  *Example:* `"name": "skill-verification-oracle"`
